    <h4>Making separate prototypes enabled specific design questions to be addressed with as much clarity as possible.

    </h4>
    <p>
        The 3D space-planning application shows three different prototype builds simultaneously, but each focuses on specific dimensions.  Even though the prototype outcome is different, but the cores are the same, they try to figure out how the audience interacts with the 3D space-planning application.  Based on these prototypes,  I can imagine what integrate prototypes look like. And they make me understand this project more clearly.

    <h4>
        Define “prototype” broadly.
    </h4>
    <p>
        This is a critical quote I learn from this paper. In my opinion, the prototype is mainly a wireframe sketch on paper or screen-based wireframe. In the article, it talks about how to use a pizza box as a laptop prototype. And tester based on the pizza box to give meaningful feedback. It makes me recall that the lecture asks us to follow the real screen size when we draw the wireframe on paper in the previous term. Because similar screen size is also a way to help the audience understand and familiar with the prototype.

    <h4>
        Know your prototype; prepare your audience.
    </h4>
    <p>
        In the book, it explained that understand the design questions and how the audience uses them. Understand the design question is quite straightforward because, as a project team. Members have different knowledge backgrounds. Let all of them clear the goal of the project is very critical. Team members can use their professional knowledge to give support.  Prepare your audience is team members working together, they can understand each other concept. However, or less expert audiences or other testers may not be able to understand some abstract concept. So the designer needs to think about who will be the audience and who will use this project. So they can decide which kind of prototype is the best way to present to the audience and get quality feedback.
