    <h2>Reading 01 - What do Prototypes Prototype?</h2>

    <h3>
      "Making separate prototypes enabled specific design questions to be
      addressed with as much clarity as possible."
    </h3>
    <p>
      The 3D space-planning application shows three different prototype builds
      simultaneously, but each focuses on specific dimensions. Even though the
      prototype outcome is different, but the cores are the same, they try to
      figure out how the audience interacts with the 3D space-planning
      application. Based on these prototypes, I can imagine what integrate
      prototypes look like. And they make me understand this project more
      clearly.
    </p>

    <h3>"Define “prototype” broadly."</h3>
    <p>
      This is a critical quote I learn from this paper. In my opinion, the
      prototype is mainly a wireframe sketch on paper or screen-based wireframe.
      In the article, it talks about how to use a pizza box as a laptop
      prototype. And tester based on the pizza box to give meaningful feedback.
      It makes me recall that the lecture asks us to follow the real screen size
      when we draw the wireframe on paper in the previous term. Because similar
      screen size is also a way to help the audience understand and familiar
      with the prototype.
    </p>
    <h3>"Know your prototype; prepare your audience."</h3>
    <p>
      In the book, it explained that understand the design questions and how the
      audience uses them. Understand the design question is quite
      straightforward because, as a project team. Members have different
      knowledge backgrounds. Let all of them clear the goal of the project is
      very critical. Team members can use their professional knowledge to give
      support. Prepare your audience is team members working together, they can
      understand each other concept. However, or less expert audiences or other
      testers may not be able to understand some abstract concept. So the
      designer needs to think about who will be the audience and who will use
      this project. So they can decide which kind of prototype is the best way
      to present to the audience and get quality feedback.

    <h2>Reading 02 - Programming Design Systems</h2>

    <h3>
      "Remember not to rush to make things pretty, and make these concepts a
      crucial part of your design process."
    </h3>
    <p>
      As an interaction designer, our design is not only visually beautiful but
      also needs to think about user experience and how to make it come true
      based on coding. Thus, we need to think about the relation of the
      components of the design, focus point, and so on.
    </p>

    <h3>
      "The term ‘design system’ is used to describe a philosophy that encourages
      designers to define the rules of their designs as a system of instructions
      that can be used on more than a single product. "
    </h3>
    <p>
      The design system is a good way to manage design outcomes and help to keep
      design consistency. This design system also can help other teammates
      quickly work with the whole project. A design system is a full product,
      which is going to help the actors of a project to build other products.
      The more integrated the system will be with the designers and developers
      workflows, the more effective it will be.
    </p>
    <h3>
      " Perceptually uniform color spaces allow us to align numbers in our code
      with the visual effect perceived in our viewers."
    </h3>
    <p>
      The method of using color is different between designer and programmer.
      Designers more depend on the eyes to value the color, but programmers use
      coding to manage the color. So sometimes visually color looks correct but
      the coding can use many different methods to create this color. So
      designer and programmer must uniform their color code to make sure the
      outcome is the same.

    <h2>Reading 03 - The Internet of Things</h2>

    <h3>
      "Nobody has embraced this conception of instrumented living more fervently
      than a loose global network of enthusiasts called the Quantified Self,
      whose slogan is “self-knowledge through numbers."
    </h3>
    <p>
      Based on the IoT, more and more people can use wearable devices to get
      their body data, such as a smart watch. So I think in the future, data
      visualization will be more and more important and how to transfer those
      complex data to easier understand graphic.
    </p>

    <h3>
      "If the ambition beneath the instrumentation of the body is a nominal
      self-mastery, and that of the home convenience, the ambition at the heart
      of the smart city is nothing other than control. "
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is a trend of the smart city and I agree that the smart city is
      about control. Cities need to operate efficiently and rationally, Managers
      based on the critical data make help the city make the change, such as
      detect traffic information to adjust the red traffic light time, this will
      alleviate traffic jams. So as designers, we need to think about how to
      apply IoT in our design and make users have more power to control the
      products.
    </p>
    <h3>
      "That in some way this outcome was always already nestled within the data,
      from the moment of its collection."
    </h3>
    <p>
      Because the result is based on the data to analysis, so I agree that the
      outcome was always already within in the data, but the data should be
      Quality data and Quantity data and related to the goals. Otherwise, these
      data may be invalid. So when we doing design, we need to wisely choose
      what data we need.
